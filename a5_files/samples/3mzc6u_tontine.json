If you save up but live longer than expected, you may run out of money.  If you rely on a government or corporate pension plan, you may be disturbed to find that most are not fully funded and rely on growth models that may be unrealistic.  If you buy an annuity, that's great - but returns may be low because those are tricky to insure.\n\n\nA tontine for retirement looks like this:  you and N other people your age are put into a bracket together.  Perhaps you all pay in a lump sum at age 59, or perhaps you pay a yearly fee from age 35-59.  Your money is invested sensibly, and starting at age 60, the administrator starts withdrawing a yearly sum to divide amongst everyone.  That yearly sum is divided evenly for all the surviving participants.  So if at age 75 only half the people are still alive, then everyone is getting twice as much money.  Last person standing gets everything.\n\nThe key advantages as I see it are:\n\n*We don't need actuaries to figure out how long everyone lives.  If everyone lives a long time, that just means your yearly check doesn't grow very fast.  Thus there's no risk of default.\n\n*Management fees can be quite low; all the manager needs to do is very simple investment, keep track of everyone's address, and keep track of who's still alive.\n\n*No reliance on the generosity or stability of the government, your former employer, etc.\n\n*Everyone who lives abnormally long gets great returns, since they are getting some of their cohort's money.\n\nBut CMV.  Are there major risks I am not forseeing?  Reasons to think that these are too abusable?  Reasons to think they won't be good retirement vehicles?",
