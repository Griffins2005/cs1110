"selftext": "Hello! I'm writing this because this is a rather pessimistic stance, and I really hope someone can change my mind.\n\nI think that, for some reason, people seem to enjoy antagonizing themselves. *We* are the ones causing climate change. *We* are the ones killing the polar bears and walruses and penguins. *We* are the reason why plastic is in the ocean, and why  the rain forest is depleting.\n\nBut I don't think it's an individual issue. If I were to cut out meat entirely, stop purchasing anything made of palm oil, only ever bike to school, and never purchase anything made of plastic or with plastic packaging, climate change would still be happening. It might help slightly, but not in the long run. I am only one person. People say that everyone's actions will add up, but I don't think that many people will ever sacrifice their current lives to save our planet's future.\n\n100 companies alone are responsible for *71 percent* of global carbon emissions. This shows that pollution is caused primarily by companies and corporations, not by 'little' people like you (probably) or me. Sure, if *everyone* stopped buying Toyota cars, they'd probably stop/reduce their emissions of carbon and drop off the list. But I think it's rather impossible to get everyone on board for that. They will keep contributing to climate change whether they have 10 million customers or 9 million, or even just 1 million.\n\nKeep America Beautiful is a good example of where my opinion lies. KAB was created in the 50's by people like the Pepsi and Coca-Cola CEOs. They're the ones that coined the term 'litterbug' and fund beach clean-ups and similar events. I think this is rather despicable, really; rather than taking responsibility for the huge amount of plastic they manufacture with, they shift all blame to individuals like you or me. Why should a bunch of people like us have to clean up the ocean for KAB due to a problem almost entirely instigated by KAB?\n\nA last thing I wanted to touch on--the self antagonizing stuff is especially bad for those of low incomes. Even if I wanted to cut out plastic and stuff entirely, I, along with what I'd argue to be most Americans, couldn't afford to. Eco-friendly products are typically much more expensive than standard ones. Cotton clothing is often much more expensive than clothing made of polyester.\n\nI don't think that using an LED bulb rather than fluorescent, or skipping a shower every other day, or boycotting everything made of palm oil is really going to do anything. This mentality is harmful not only for antagonizing people with low incomes, but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people. Voting is a good start to solve these issues--holding politicians accountable for keeping companies, corporations, and net carbon emissions in check--but I cannot yet vote, hence the title \"nothing I can do.\" Overall, though, I think the solution isn't for us to take responsibility, but for those with power to hold corporations and companies responsible. Please change my view! And if there *is* something I can do that meaningfully impacts climate change, please share that with me!\n\nEDIT: Woah, thanks so much for all the insightful comments and great discussion! I've never had a CMV or post like this, and I really appreciate all of the conversation! Right now, thanks to you all, I've changed my view to something like: it's good to strive to act environmentally-friendly via recycling, conserving energy, etc, as it's the moral thing to do, and one's actions may influence others. Alone, nothing I can do will meaningfully contribute to ending climate change and pollution or create a long-term change. However, by acting as a unit with others and placing pressure on others, a larger impact may be made. Framing climate change as solely an individual issue is still harmful, not only for antagonizing people with low incomes, but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people. Voting and lobbying are perhaps the best ways to combat climate change at this point. That, and not having kids.\n\nI didn't expect this many comments and I have homework to do so it might take me a while, but I'll try to reply to everyone. Thanks!",

Eating meat, for example, is worse for humans than most seem to realize, particularly when combined with the typical American's sugary diet... eating meat and sugar has been linked with diabetes.  At least when it comes to diet it's likely in most peoples' self interest to stop consuming animal products; the more spent at the grocery store to buy other foods winds up being less than a triple bypass down the line.

When does anyone decide to intentionally make themselves ultimately worse off?  Even suicide is a decision to escape pain, not a decision to end pleasure.  There never was a happy person who intended to end their existence.  So pointing out that it wouldn't be wrong to do as you want isn't true; while it's true none ever do actually do anything they don't want given their understanding of the circumstances the fact that someone doesn't want to do something doesn't itself mean that person wouldn't be better off changing his or her mind.  Wanting itself speaks to appearances and appearance can be deceiving.\n\nInsofar as reducing consumption in other ways, consider this: if we had to connect the dots as to how every decision we make gets back to us then we'd all cheat whenever we thought we'd get away with it.  We'd see the upside of cheating (money, suppose), fail to see the downside (?), and lift the wallet or rob the bank.  While it's rational in a sense to live this way it follows from a narrow conception of self interest.  Don't we get to decide what's in our self interest?  Don't we get to decide our values?  Should we decide upon values inconsistent with cheating then we don't see cheating as being in our self interest.  Personally I see it as an ugly thing to require others lose in order to win and so I'm motivated to seek universally ideal solutions.

"body": "It's a shame your parents think that way, but it's very likely that they formed those views because those were the views of the people around them throughout their lives.

In other words, exposure to different viewpoints is a very important thing.\n\n&gt; One question I have, though: if skipping plastic packaging or becoming vegan is pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things, should I do so solely to make a point to others? Leading a vegan, plastic-free, etc lifestyle can be very expensive. Why wouldn't I just talk to people about climate change instead? Does demonstration really have that much more of an impact?\n\nWell I would guess that practising what you preach would lend your arguments greater weight, yes. People are impressed and influenced by those who seem to live by their convictions. But on the other hand there's also nothing wrong with not doing those things if you are unwilling to sacrifice aspects of your own wellbeing for a political gesture. It all comes down to how passionate about it you are I suppose. Personally I am unable to get over the hurdle of my own self-interest: I know I could take steps to be a more ethically and environmentally conscious consumer, but I am unwilling to sacrifice personal wellbeing for a political cause. It's a selfish position, I acknowledge that.\n\n&gt;And a personal question: are you optimistic for the outcome of the next American election?\n\nI've got absolutely no idea what to think.

"body": "So, OP should feel that “taking action”- participating in democracy, raising awareness \namong other things... Is adequate?\n\nI’m jealous. It must be really pleasant to live\nwith such a vaguely optimistic image of the future, but I wouldn’t know. \n\nThe United States is, what, a few hundred million people? Out of how many worldwide? Nearly eight billion? K.\n\nAssuming that mainstream American culture not only accepts that human beings have made an irreversible impact on the Earth... \n\nAssuming that a *democratically elected majority* of people in Congress will do any more than they absolutely must against the sheer financial might of those who profit from loose regulations, shifted responsibilities, pollution and death...\n\nWhat would that country be like? You’re not gonna like it. I put it at the end for that reason.\n\nDo you really think that within the next 50 years, the hypercapitalists of countries like India, South Africa, Zambia, Ethiopia, Congo, Argentina, Paraguay, Venezeula, China... Are going to even blink when our virtue-signalling asses try to convince them that coal must be abandoned as an energy source? That they should stop having so many goddamn children? (Looking at you too, Midwest)\n\nYeah, maybe if we like... *Really* mean it. \n(Not a fucking chance.)\n\nSomething **cataclysmic** will happen before Americans take notice. Maybe extreme weather patterns begin to wash coastal homes into driftwood by the thousands. Maybe one of those fires in California just keeps spreading until half the country’s aflame. \n\nWhatever does happen, will need to claim at least half as many American lives as World War II to accomplish more than a few eco friendly water bottle companies. By that time, it’ll be far too late and at best life will be unrecognizable to a person from the Boomers’ generation.\n\n\nHere goes:\n\n-\tAmerican car manufacturers will be legally prohibited from producing vehicles or engines of any kind that burn fossil fuels.\n\n-\tAll car manufacturers will be legally prohibited from selling vehicles or engines of any kind that burn fossil fuels within the territorial United States.\n\n-\tLobbying will be 100% illegal, punishable by *years* in prison. Look at the mandatory minimum for selling crack. One crack dealer ruins what, 50 families maximum? Lobbyists would call that a poor return on an investment- they ruin by the million.\n\n-\tReproductive rights are one of the things civil rights activists are *still* fighting for today. But as overall world population grows while food and energy sources (hopefully) change... I predict that future generations will look back on stories about families with 3+ children with horror, shaking their heads as you try to explain “it was a different time...”. We’re gonna need to regulate the fuck out of this- people just straight up aren’t responsible.\n\n\nI think the most likely outcome will be the following:\n\n1.\tCataclysmic disaster, claiming lives by the hundred thousand. If it didn’t happen in North America, please roll again.\n\n2.\tRage, followed by a well intentioned but shoddy attempt at redemption.\n\n3.\tFinger pointing. Some people go to prison, some don’t. Scandals abound. Doesn’t solve much, but it sure feels that way. \n\n5.\tThis continues 3-5 years and as America takes a more proactive role in the trainwreck our world will be, the nationalists will catch on- any progress will be counterbalanced by breathless, xenophobic stories about the dizzying amount of pollution from X country.\n\n6.\tNow Americans are discussing whether to eradicate over a billion lives, “to save the human race”. Soundbites: “... they don’t know any better...”, “... we can’t change history, but we can ensure that human beings have a future...”",

You're correct that taking some specific individual action like becoming vegan or refusing to buy plastic packaging is an insignificant gesture in the face of such a gargantuan problem. But you are ignoring the factor of the influence your actions have on the opinions of others.\n\nIf you take action in some way, the people you know may be more inclined to follow suit. Or even if they don't follow suit, they may be more sympathetic to the environmentalist cause. We all make hundreds of connections over our lifetime, and we all have the power to influence others' views on things. It's the image we project to others that often has more power than the actions we take. The actions themselves are gestures with small physical value, but potentially huge symbolic value.\n\nAnd my argument applies to voting as well. Even when you are old enough to vote, your vote means very little in itself. But go out and convince 5 people that protecting the environment is important and you've just potentially won 5 votes for environmentally conscious political candidates. That's 5 times more powerful than your own vote.\n\nSo to sum up it's not all about the direct effects of your actions: it's also about how the way you live your life may influence the views of those around you, and the views of those around you matter because they translate into votes at the next election. Probably the single best thing that could have happened for the environment recently is Donald Trump not being elected president, and if more people had cared more about the environment leading up to the last American election, he may not have been in power now.",

It's equivalent to you plus 8 other people living like low-carbon saints for your entire life (car free, never fly again, strict vegan, all green energy) or 684 people comprehensively recycling their entire lives. \n\nHave one less kid. \n\nYou are right that all the other common suggestions are just feel-good gestures in comparison when you actually [quantify their impact](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541). They are all blown out of the water by having less kids. [It's not even close](https://i.imgur.com/Z5nOSZV.png). \n\nIn a way the other suggestions are like the nuclear bomb drills students did during the cold war. Sure it might do a little good for people at the fringes of the bomb zone. But the drills were more for the public could *feel* like they were doing something than actually having a significant impact. \n\nIn increasing order of things you can do to help climate change by impact (tons of CO2/year, [paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541), [article w/visualization](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children)):  \n\n***\n* Eat a plant-based diet - 0.82  \n* Buy green energy - 1.47  \n* Avoid one roundtrip transatlantic flight - 1.60  \n* Live car free (don't own a car) - 2.4 (switch to hybrid 0.52, eliminate electric car 1.15)   \n* Total of above - **6.29**  \n\n***  \n\nversus  \n\n***  \n\n* Don't have children - each child - **58.6**  \n\n***\n\nRecycling doesn't even make the list. A US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives. \n\nOf course everyone should do everything on the list. But between the two I have more respect (in terms of global warming) for a childless SUV-driving carnivore than someone with a couple kids lecturing everyone in sight about meat and recycling.",

"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one thing you can do that will dwarf everything else you do. It&amp;#39;s equivalent to you plus 8 other people living like low-carbon saints for your entire life (car free, never fly again, strict vegan, all green energy) or 684 people comprehensively recycling their entire lives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have one less kid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are right that all the other common suggestions are just feel-good gestures in comparison when you actually &lt;a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541\"&gt;quantify their impact&lt;/a&gt;. They are all blown out of the water by having less kids. &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Z5nOSZV.png\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s not even close&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a way the other suggestions are like the nuclear bomb drills students did during the cold war. Sure it might do a little good for people at the fringes of the bomb zone. But the drills were more for the public could &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they were doing something than actually having a significant impact. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In increasing order of things you can do to help climate change by impact (tons of CO2/year, &lt;a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children\"&gt;article w/visualization&lt;/a&gt;):  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Eat a plant-based diet - 0.82&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Buy green energy - 1.47&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Avoid one roundtrip transatlantic flight - 1.60&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Live car free (don&amp;#39;t own a car) - 2.4 (switch to hybrid 0.52, eliminate electric car 1.15)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Total of above - &lt;strong&gt;6.29&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;versus  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t have children - each child - &lt;strong&gt;58.6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recycling doesn&amp;#39;t even make the list. A US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course everyone should do everything on the list. But between the two I have more respect (in terms of global warming) for a childless SUV-driving carnivore than someone with a couple kids lecturing everyone in sight about meat and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

"body": "Not trying to change your view, since I agree with you. You might find Prof. Jem Bendell's writings on Deep Adaptation interesting.\n\n\"Deep Adaptation refers to the personal and collective changes that might help us to prepare for – and live with – a climate-induced collapse of our societies. Unlike mainstream work on adaptation to climate change, it doesn’t assume that our current economic, social, and political systems can be resilient in the face of rapid climate change. When using the term social or societal collapse, we are referring the uneven ending to our current means of sustenance, shelter, security, pleasure, identity and meaning. Others may prefer the term societal breakdown when referring to the same process. We consider this process to be inevitable, because of our view that humanity will not be able to respond globally fast enough to protect our food supplies from chaotic weather. People who consider that societal collapse or breakdown is either possible, likely or already unfolding, also are interested in deep adaptation.\n\nFour questions guide our work on Deep Adaptation within the forum:\n\nResilience: what do we most value that we want to keep and how?\n\nRelinquishment: what do we need to let go of so as not to make matters worse?\n\nRestoration: what could we bring back to help us with these difficult times?\n\nReconciliation: with what and whom shall we make peace as we awaken to our mutual mortality?\"\n\nhttps://jembendell.wordpress.com/2019/03/17/the-love-in-deep-adaptation-a-philosophy-for-the-forum/",

"body": "This is me responding to both this post and your OP.\n\nThere seem to be various things I think you should understand further before having your view changed. I study economics so I'll try to make my arguments based in economics. \n\nFirstly you are very concerned about things being more expensive. That is definitely a huge motivation for people's day-to-day lives, to make sure their money goes as far as possible, it's human instinct to want more good stuff. Having good stuff increases what we economists call our \"utility\". However the price on the label may be innacurate. Think about it from a more bird's eye view perspective. The carbon (or plastic waste) footprint of buying that good incurs a cost on the earth. We are totally used to prices being in £s (if you are american, $s) which is hard to do for externality costs( == costs that aren't on the wrapper but which reveal themselves, by conducting a thought experiment, to other people at a different time or place). \n\nThe thought experiment: Because the cost of that extra plastic bottle in the waste bin might be the straw that breaks the camel's back and ecological collapse might(!) ensue. The effect on human agriculture for instance would be enormous. If there are no (or hardly any) insect species species then there is less capability pollinate crops== less food. Or there is hugely reduced biodiversity meaning less carbon recapture in turn causing runaway greenhouse effect to go even faster==&gt; Extreme temperatures cause crops to wilt and die. Eventually we can no longer feed the billions of humans on the planet. Starvation would then cause desperation, extremism, migration like never seen in history (at least tens of millions if not billions). Maybe wars ensue. Wars heavily impact trade. Maybe America is forced to join a war to protect its national interest. All of these possible results of the dangers of climate change have vast cost, well into the trillions of dollars. Having less resources on the global market means fewer make it to the shops in your local town, and less is by definition worse as above (shops will notice less and price those goods on the shelf higher, due to relationship between price, supply and demand). Perhaps that favourite fruit of yours was farmed in Africa and now there is no longer a trade link from there- this is a case of reduced choice (and reduced preferred choice at that) so you have to substitute that fruit with another fruit- apples maybe- which you don't like as much- again your utility has decreased. Maybe the government has to enforce extreme taxation to protect the country, like they did in ww2- less wealth for you to spend- lower utility. Maybe you are drafted into this \"Climate world war\" because america is desperate for manpower- you can't live the life and career you always dreamt of so your lifetime utility (the addition of all the positive utility moments in your life) is markedly reduced. Maybe you die in the climate war- congrats your utility is now absolute zero! *\n\nThe above thought experiment is to point out that a small decrease in utility today could have a huge utility impact in 50 or 100 years (on the assumption that you believe the climate science, and then do the economics calculations of what that means).\n\nThe next stage is to come to terms with the fact that spending more money on these carbon neutral/environmentally friendly items DOES decrease your utility today (you bought that expensive water- sorry, you can't have those chocolate bars because that was your last few $s from this month's paycheck). But your lifetime utility increases. * However this of course is the hard part. Humans are very well understood to have short-term bias when making choices. A good thing in 100 years is modelled in economics to be worth, in today's money, a lot less than the same good thing today. So it is up to your own discipline to act against the human \"more now\" urge, to protect yourself, your future happiness and wealth (and utility!), your children (which both add to your utility to see them happy, but also have utility of their own), your neighbour's children and ultimately the whole world, from being worse off and more miserable and dying violent deaths.\n\n*Afterthought:\nI didn't want to put this in the main body as I thought it might disrupt the flow, but there is a further economics concept to add, which is \"Expected utility\". With the camel's back analogy you could rightly ask \"what if that plastic bottle didn't tip us over the edge?\". Therefore an economist adds statistics and probability to the mix. What if runaway climate change with all its woes is not a certain event, but an event that has a particular probability of happening (and then there remains a chance of it not happening!) What that actual value is depends on a lot more factors that vary (wobble in their value) a lot. Therefore you do something called \"taking the expectation\". What is the most likely probability for all these factors- plug them into the equation- come up with an \"expectation\" of runaway climate change actually happening, say 64.33210861% (completely made up of course). Then the act of you deciding to take this reddit thread to heart and changing your actions may bump the expectation down by 0.00000001% to 64.33210860% of happening. Maybe so many good arguments were made in this thread that  a hundred people changed their actions so the expectation goes down by 0.00000100% to 64.33210761%. If everyone in the western world chips in in making a real difference, maybe the expectation goes down by 0.3% to 34% of even happening. Whether big or small, every single act makes the future dystopian world less likely to happen. Therefore every act has a good effect and is worth doing.\n\nBlimey I wrote way too much, sorry for anyone going through it all. If anyone thinks it needs to have more paragraphs, tell me and i'll try to work something out.",

The same group of people push kids in lakes over and over. Of course, it would be nice to just be able to help the kid every single time and do nothing about the instigators.

And now imagine a crowd of a hundred people standing there watching that child drown, all with the same logic to defend their inaction. What does that logic mean to that dying child or to our dying planet?\n\nThe fact is that you're just standing around while that kid drowns in the lake because you think you should be able to push a button or fill out a bubble in a voting booth and then elect some people who will spend months debating and drafting bills about who should save that kid and how. And then when they do have the details nailed down, the organization they have to create and staff to save the kid will be led by some antinatalist who finds a loophole as to why the kid shouldn't be saved in this situation. Meanwhile, that kid has long since been dead.\n\nThe fact is that we do have laws and organizations in place *already* that are supposed to hold corporations and companies responsible.

You want the messiest, hardest to manage, most easily corruptible, slow-acting solution to an immediate problem that needs addressing right now.\n\nThere are a million little ways you could attempt to live a waste free life style within your budget and ability. Do some basic research. If you don't care to try, then at least admit you just don't actually care instead of trying to rationalize why you should get the credit of caring without actually living like you do. You are contributing to the problem and making excuses as to why you shouldn't be held accountable.

What does that logic mean to that dying child or to our dying planet?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact is that you&amp;#39;re just standing around while that kid drowns in the lake because you think you should be able to push a button or fill out a bubble in a voting booth and then elect some people who will spend months debating and drafting bills about who should save that kid and how. And then when they do have the details nailed down, the organization they have to create and staff to save the kid will be led by some antinatalist who finds a loophole as to why the kid shouldn&amp;#39;t be saved in this situation. Meanwhile, that kid has long since been dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact is that we do have laws and organizations in place &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; that are supposed to hold corporations and companies responsible. How well is that working out for us? Why do the agencies, like the EPA and FDA, wind up filled with insiders from the industries that they&amp;#39;re supposed to regulate? You want the messiest, hardest to manage, most easily corruptible, slow-acting solution to an immediate problem that needs addressing right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a million little ways you could attempt to live a waste free life style within your budget and ability. Do some basic research. If you don&amp;#39;t care to try, then at least admit you just don&amp;#39;t actually care instead of trying to rationalize why you should get the credit of caring without actually living like you do. You are contributing to the problem and making excuses as to why you shouldn&amp;#39;t be held accountable. But no one is going to care about your excuses 100 years from now when they&amp;#39;re dealing with the mess you helped make and did nothing to stop when you were well aware that something needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It provides an outsized level of control to people who primarily provide monetary input into production rather than work input into production. The system's direction represents only a small subset of its society.\n\nSo, if the people who control the direction these companies chart don't take responsibility for the harm they are doing to all of us, then those individuals need to be held accountable.  \n\nIf the current government won't hold them personally accountable, those in government need to also be held accountable.  \n\nIf the voting public won't oppose a government that won't hold the individuals driving these companies accountable, then that part of the public too need to be held accountable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou may not be able to vote, but you can set the tone for conversations about these things:  make it clear to those you interact with why we have to look at major sources of carbon contribution as acts by those individuals who have direct influence on it.

Energy production is the largest sector contributor to carbon emissions, and many states, localities, provinces, etc do not offer incentives for transition to sustainable energy sources.

And it adds up fast! We all have so much potential to make positive differences. And I will mention, you never know who's watching! Sometimes my little changes seem futile, but I've had a few family members and friends make changes based on what they were seeing in me. You matter! Every coffee matters : )",

If you can do something good and try your best to spread that mentality to the people around you, things can change drastically when there are enough people gather around. \n\nIt's also true that even when there's only 1 million users of big company products, they still harm the environment, however think of the nature of a company, they want to make as much as profit as possible, so when there's a diminishing demand for their products, they will try to find different ways to attract more consumers, which will come from the consumer demand itself. For example: a cosmetic company produces products from palm oil whose consequences are to destroy the biodiversed environment, but now the majority of consumers boycotts their products and looks for a better, more sustainable option. That cosmetic company will have no choice but to change their strategy to adopt (more sustainable way to produce their products) or die out. We live in a world with million of coporations complete intensively everyday, and we consumers have the power to control them if we do it collectivistically. \n\nSo next time, if you do something good for the environment, don't take it from a pessimistic perspective, but rather think how I can spread my good deeds and get the people on board with me doing it because that's how you make the change, the difference. \n\nHope this change your view!",

"body": "The BEST way to communicate with companies as an individual with relatively low power is to be educated on what you buy and how you buy it. It might not seem like it makes a huge difference at first, but it can have drastic effects down the line. \n\nFor example, let’s say drink you a 2-liter of soda every week. You purchase it from the same store biweekly so you’re buying 2 large plastic bottles  each time. If you suddenly decided you were going to switch to just drinking water from your tap, there would be 2 extra bottles on the shelf at the end of the 2 weeks (we’re keeping this simple so it’s assuming that all other things remain the same). Then the same thing would happen the next two weeks. If the sodas came in boxes of 6, and yours weren’t the only ones leftover, they might start ordering one less box a month, so they don’t build up too much supply. One less box being shipped would mean less weight being shipped which would mean less gas used in transport. It also would mean one less box being used and less tape being used to seal the box and less power for the forklift to collect that box and bring it to the truck and hopefully all of those things would move up the system like ditching the sodas did.\n\nIn addition to the fact that you’re saving those resources, the regional distributor or some other person might notice their sales dropped wherever (especially if more people joined or if it were purchases of larger ticket items not sodas). Companies don’t like that. If they keep getting disappointed by lower sales, they’ll want to do something to change to get their sales back up. \n\nThis is the sometimes the reason why companies change practices. To continue the previous example, if enough people stop purchasing plastic bottles of soda, the company might start offering their single serving drinks in glass bottles in addition to plastic bottles. Now people who had not stopped drinking the soda would have the option of a more environmentally friendly way to drink sodas that they had not had access to previously. Perhaps now eco conscious people who normally drink a separate brand of a similar flavor soda notice this new option of a glass bottle. They decide the slight taste difference is worth switching to a more eco friendly packaging. Now maybe the other soda company will change to compete.\n\nThis style of change can end up forcing people who are not shopping eco friendly to shop better. Essentially if companies realized there was a market for eco conscious people, they could try to alter their product to make it easier to recycle or compost the packaging. Then everyone purchasing it would have the option to keep the packaging out of the trash.\n\nAs for eco friendly life styles being inaccessible to the lower class, there are a lot of ways out there to help the environment and save money at the same time. For example, get a window planter for inside and plant a few different types of herbs. Now you never have to purchase those herbs in a plastic package. Also, shopping local is great for the environment and much healthier. Many times the farmers market can have items cheaper than the supermarket. Some areas even offer a SNAP match program where people with SNAP (EBT, Food stamps) can double their money at the farmers market by getting all produce half off. \n\nAnother thing that you can do to help the environment while also saving money is altering the way the you use utilities. Make sure to never have unnecessary things plugged in (anything plugged into your wall is using power even if it’s not on). Only wash full loads of laundry. Switch from baths to showers. Employ the “if it’s yellow let it mellow” method of flushing the toilet. Toilet flushing can use up to 5 gallons each flush for older toilets. If you can’t afford to hire a plumber to fix a leaky faucet, place a bowl under the faucet and use the water for anything from cooking to watering plants. Turn off your AC or heat on nice days. Learn to make your own beauty/cleaning supplies. Learn to garden if you have a backyard. \n\nNow most importantly imagine if all of those changes were made by one person. Imagine how much less water, electric, and gas would be wasted over a lifetime. That’s still a huge difference for just one person.\n\nEdit: a few missed words",

It might not seem like it makes a huge difference at first, but it can have drastic effects down the line. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say drink you a 2-liter of soda every week. You purchase it from the same store biweekly so you’re buying 2 large plastic bottles  each time. If you suddenly decided you were going to switch to just drinking water from your tap, there would be 2 extra bottles on the shelf at the end of the 2 weeks (we’re keeping this simple so it’s assuming that all other things remain the same). Then the same thing would happen the next two weeks. If the sodas came in boxes of 6, and yours weren’t the only ones leftover, they might start ordering one less box a month, so they don’t build up too much supply. One less box being shipped would mean less weight being shipped which would mean less gas used in transport. It also would mean one less box being used and less tape being used to seal the box and less power for the forklift to collect that box and bring it to the truck and hopefully all of those things would move up the system like ditching the sodas did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fact that you’re saving those resources, the regional distributor or some other person might notice their sales dropped wherever (especially if more people joined or if it were purchases of larger ticket items not sodas). Companies don’t like that. If they keep getting disappointed by lower sales, they’ll want to do something to change to get their sales back up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the sometimes the reason why companies change practices. To continue the previous example, if enough people stop purchasing plastic bottles of soda, the company might start offering their single serving drinks in glass bottles in addition to plastic bottles. Now people who had not stopped drinking the soda would have the option of a more environmentally friendly way to drink sodas that they had not had access to previously. Perhaps now eco conscious people who normally drink a separate brand of a similar flavor soda notice this new option of a glass bottle. They decide the slight taste difference is worth switching to a more eco friendly packaging. Now maybe the other soda company will change to compete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This style of change can end up forcing people who are not shopping eco friendly to shop better. Essentially if companies realized there was a market for eco conscious people, they could try to alter their product to make it easier to recycle or compost the packaging. Then everyone purchasing it would have the option to keep the packaging out of the trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for eco friendly life styles being inaccessible to the lower class, there are a lot of ways out there to help the environment and save money at the same time. For example, get a window planter for inside and plant a few different types of herbs. Now you never have to purchase those herbs in a plastic package. Also, shopping local is great for the environment and much healthier. Many times the farmers market can have items cheaper than the supermarket. Some areas even offer a SNAP match program where people with SNAP (EBT, Food stamps) can double their money at the farmers market by getting all produce half off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing that you can do to help the environment while also saving money is altering the way the you use utilities. Make sure to never have unnecessary things plugged in (anything plugged into your wall is using power even if it’s not on). Only wash full loads of laundry. Switch from baths to showers. Employ the “if it’s yellow let it mellow” method of flushing the toilet. Toilet flushing can use up to 5 gallons each flush for older toilets. If you can’t afford to hire a plumber to fix a leaky faucet, place a bowl under the faucet and use the water for anything from cooking to watering plants. Turn off your AC or heat on nice days. Learn to make your own beauty/cleaning supplies. Learn to garden if you have a backyard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now most importantly imagine if all of those changes were made by one person. Imagine how much less water, electric, and gas would be wasted over a lifetime. That’s still a huge difference for just one person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: a few missed words&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

If I were to cut out meat entirely, stop purchasing anything made of palm oil, only ever bike to school, and never purchase anything made of plastic or with plastic packaging, climate change would still be happening.\n\nWell, if you were to eat today, that would not stop world hunger. But is that a reason not to eat?\n\nYou are not Jesus. You are not Superman. You are not Atlas. The world does not rest on your shoulders. Just a tiny bit of it. What can be expected of you is that you take responsibility for the tiny bit that is your part.\n\n&gt;100 companies alone are responsible for 71 percent of global carbon emissions. This shows that pollution is caused primarily by companies and corporations, not by 'little' people like you (probably) or me\n\nAnd you purchased stuff from them. Therefore it's your responsibility. Just that part. Nothing more, but nothing less either. If you want to complain about what these companies do, your position isn't very strong if you keep giving them money. Especially since it's much easier to change what you personally consume, than to hold a company responsible. If you're not even capable of picking something from a menu that is not beef, then why should a company be scared of you?\n\n&gt;Why should a bunch of people like us have to clean up the ocean for KAB due to a problem almost entirely instigated by KAB?\n\nBecause you give them money to produce these packages.\n\nMore importantly, it's not an either/or proposition. You can, at the same time, reduce your own packaging footprint *and* insist on regulating companies. They're not mutually exclusive.\n\n&gt;A last thing I wanted to touch on--the self antagonizing stuff is especially bad for those of low incomes. Even if I wanted to cut out plastic and stuff entirely, I, along with what I'd argue to be most Americans, couldn't afford to. Eco-friendly products are typically much more expensive than standard ones. Cotton clothing is often much more expensive than clothing made of polyester.\n\nBicycling is cheaper than driving. Buying less stuff is cheaper than buying more. Eating vegan is cheaper thatn eating meat. Drinking water is cheaper than chugging soda. Not smoking is cheaper than smoking.\n\nAnyway, even if there are good reasons, or less good reasons, that make it harder for people to adopt better habits, that does not contradict that these habits are better. Furthermore, they may hinder some people, but so what? That doesn't stop *you*.\n\n&gt;I don't think that using an LED bulb rather than fluorescent, or skipping a shower every other day, or boycotting everything made of palm oil is really going to do anything\n\nNot checking the road before you cross, or brushing your teeth, or not using condoms *probably* isn't going to harm you either. Does that mean you shouldn't? Again, as I said above: don't measure the succes of your individual actions on observable results on a planetary scale. Unless you're Jesus, Superman, or Atlas.\n\n&gt;This mentality is harmful not only for antagonizing people with low incomes, but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people.\n\nIt doesn't shift blame, it opens up an avenue of action. Again, nothing stops you from continuing to campaign to make companies change their practices, and for legislation that forces them to. But hold on, wait a second? You *are* campaigning to make companies change, aren't you? Because you'd be a huge hypocrite if you claimed that companies were to blame so you didn't have to change, and then didn't do anything to make the companies change either! That would mean you were just shifting blame!\n\n&gt;Voting is a good start to solve these issues--holding politicians accountable for keeping companies, corporations, and net carbon emissions in check--but I cannot yet vote, hence the title \"nothing I can do.\"\n\nThat didn't stop [Greta Thunberg from doing something](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg). She's 15. Get off your ass.\n\n(She's also vegan, by the way. Doing something on a larger scale didn't stop her from doing something on a personal scale. That's not exceptional either.)\n\ntl;dr: Por qué no los dos?",

YOU could be the guy who makes alternative energy cheaper than coal for the developing world.\n\nWith this pessimistic attitude you won’t be able to accomplish anything.  But if you take the time to do the research and develop the solution, you could change the world.\n\nAfter high school I passed up college to do independent study. 4 years later and I’ve now patented a device to turn thunder into electricity. It took a long time but I’ve made something that I can use to change the world. And I have more ideas that I will be working on next.\n\nTurn your anger and frustration into research and development.

YOU could be the guy who makes alternative energy cheaper than coal for the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this pessimistic attitude you won’t be able to accomplish anything.  But if you take the time to do the research and develop the solution, you could change the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After high school I passed up college to do independent study. 4 years later and I’ve now patented a device to turn thunder into electricity.

Even the opposite, I have become more cautious on having final opinions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For many years, greenhouse effect theory firmly held status of unproven hypothesis. Than the loudest among left-populist politicians in number of countries started with aggressive anti-carbon emissions agendas. That gave them notable success on elections in number of places, and anti-carbon agenda spread over global politics as a disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it realistically reached status of dogma, as its scientific status never changed. In other words, no any strong proof that would support that hypothesis emerged in last 15 years and during that the same time period politicians have become mad about carbon emissions chasing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fear much that there is high probability that all these efforts are useless, and carbon emissions chasing is not different from medieval witches chasing to fight plague.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The fact that certain industry sectors and global corporations are responsible for the pollution, and the ones to change to combat climate change, does not also mean that given that any individual can never amount to the need level of change - therefore it is useless to be responsible.
