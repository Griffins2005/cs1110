The term has been around since 2002 and is named after British journalist Robert Fisk, whose articles in the *Independent* often would do this. It didn't really rise in popularity [until last year](https://www.cnet.com/news/fisk-the-word-thats-all-the-rage-at-dictionary-com/), after the NRA put out a video using the term and it was finally added to dictionary.com. It still isn't used too often (I've seen it only a handful of times), but I recognized its meaning right away because it's exactly how I prefer to respond to posts or debates. I will frequently go through an entire post, sometimes line by line, and craft my response by quoting specific sentences and then responding to them.\n\nBut after thinking about it... I feel like it encapsulates the sentiment of \"missing the forest for the trees.\" It replaces the goal of a conversation where you persuade someone to change their view with the goal of being technically correct and expecting them to give up. It's more about being right (or proving someone else wrong) than it is about convincing the other person. \n\nBy fisking, you lose the overall narrative flow of someone's view. Word choice gets heavily criticized, and rather then getting clarification on *what they mean,* you go for explanation for *why they used that particular word.* It often turns a conversation adversarial, [and we have data to show that this makes arguments less persuasive](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/10/how-to-change-someones-mind-according-to-science/). That same article (and the associated study from Cornell University) shows that the best ways to persuade someone include reforming the original argument using different words, having a calm tone, and utilizing hedging words such as *could*. Fisking, in my experience, doesn't do this. It focused on exact phrasing, ignores context, and speaks in specifics. \n\nAt the same time, if you already believe whatever the fisking party is writing, this will just make you more secure in your view. Every point that gets dissected solidifies that, yes, you are right and this other view is flimsy. I'm not sure how exactly I'd look this up, but it strikes me as meaning that [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) plays heavily into it. \n\nSo, there we go. I admit I myself am guilty of fisking, and my view is that utilizing this technique for responses is ultimately less persuasive than replying narratively. \"Technically correct\" is not, in fact, the \"best correct\" in this case. \n\n**Edit:** After seeing some people mention this, I wanted to clarify that I am referring to fisking arguments **here** in r/changemyview. Yes, it can be effective in other circumstances, but I had this sub in mind in particular, as it's my chosen way to respond. \n\n**Edit 2:** Really sorry folks, but I'm heading out on a trip through the weekend early tomorrow and won't have a chance to hit up the newest responses until I'm back. A lot of you brought up good points and I promise to get to your comments and award more deltas (if applicable) when I'm back.

Another poster here gave an example from /r/murderedbywords that did something similar with several gender-related words. It was entertaining to watch them be fisked and dissected, but I guarantee it didn't persuade the person posting that.\n\nWhich is why I clarified about this applying to CMV. People *shouldn't* be arguing in bad faith here. And when they throw out analogies, either the analogies can be part of the response... or disregarded. If someone uses an analogy as poor as the women/men/meat/lions one you provided, it wouldn't be persuasive. Thus defeating the purpose of changing their view, no?\n\nI agree gish gallop IS a big problem.

Another poster here gave an example from &lt;a href=\"/r/murderedbywords\"&gt;/r/murderedbywords&lt;/a&gt; that did something similar with several gender-related words. It was entertaining to watch them be fisked and dissected, but I guarantee it didn&amp;#39;t persuade the person posting that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why I clarified about this applying to CMV. People &lt;em&gt;shouldn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; be arguing in bad faith here. And when they throw out analogies, either the analogies can be part of the response... or disregarded. If someone uses an analogy as poor as the women/men/meat/lions one you provided, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be persuasive. Thus defeating the purpose of changing their view, no?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree gish gallop IS a big problem. It&amp;#39;s just not the problem I&amp;#39;m discussing here :) Speaking of which... can you provide examples of &amp;quot;non-extreme fisking&amp;quot; that change views? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

            "body": "Sometimes what can look like fisking is actually just trying to clarify what you're talking about. For example, if you talked at me this long without break, I would just go Mmm and ignore you offlien. That's a long time to talk to anyone without getting feedback or being interrupted.\n\nIt's the very nature of written forum communication. Obviously, you are not going to be waiting around to get all the replies before you make the rest of your point. If we were in a chat situation, you would be free to do so, but in this system where you leave a comment and come back, fisking is the only way to really tease out what you're actually replying to. While I agree that breaking down a sentence to the point of absurdity *is* non-persuasive and bullish, I do think there's merit somewhat in some fisking unless someone is going to write tiny sentences and wait for reply.\n\n&gt;It replaces the goal of a conversation where you persuade someone to change their view with the goal of being technically correct and expecting them to give up.\n\nThat's the extreme end of fisking. I have seen people break up sentences into parts. Even just a phrase, such as toxic masculinity. That's one phrase that's isolated and fisked on a regular basis. Mostly they tend to be subjects where participants have very strong positive or negative feelings. Most people who hear the phrase toxic masculinity have an opinion of it. They mostly don't bother to research it, but they feel very strongly about just the very phrase. What they lack in substance, they make up for in rage. They are not actually looking to persuade someone, but rather do some grandstanding and rage at the person about the phrase. So you're not really doing much more than being ignored by both sides. \n\nIn the case of my above quote though, if we were standing face to face, you would see that I wanted to speak to you in this point in the conversation. Body language would have told you so. I believe it is unhelpful to just give a vague account of what you are replying to, because if this was a conversation, your viewpoint would be honed before you continued down the path of the whole thing.\n\nI would also say that it's all about communication. If CMV were all about just writing what you think on a wall, and leaving it there, there's no real persuasion going on. It would be like a blog, where no one replies. And that is the most frustrating thing about replying on forums like this - you can make a post and no one will reply to it. But if someone wishes to speak to a particular point, they can highlight what they are replying to, rather than putting just their general thoughts about it under your general thoughts about it.\n\n&gt;Every point that gets dissected solidifies that, yes, you are right and this other view is flimsy.\n\nAgain, this is just the extreme end. I think that very few people actually bother to read them. They do start to become mere walls of text with simplistic replies. They are akin to the people who post walls upon walls of links to relevant things that they think prove a point. People are happy to upvote them because they're sure something good is buried in there (and because of the simplicity they know the poster's view from the first 2 lines) but that doesn't mean that anyone is reading it. I know if you scroll off my page with fisking, I'm not bothering to comb through all the quotes and stuff. I don't actually count it either way, because there could be any kind of dross hidden in those characters. It's rare to find someone whom you are in lockstep with, so even if you were to upvote for the first two lines, few people will read through to point 34 where you're talking about how the Jews must die.\n\n&gt;\"Technically correct\" is not, in fact, the \"best correct\" in this case. \n\nI agree here that technically correct is not the best correct. It's usually not even correct. It is devoid of context most of the time, and extreme fisking is a problem. \n\nBut the other side of the poor argument problem on Reddit is the amount of off-topic and segue conversations happen on Reddit. It is the nature of the beast it seems. But it's absolutely terrible argument style, and a real problem here. Debates become a joke, with everyone using an analogy and then segueing off into their topic of choice. \n\nFor example, another usual example is the woman walking at night is like wearing a meat suit in a lion cage. You can discuss whether women have equal human rights or if men are instinctual creatures who will attack *without* making that analogy. But if that were to be debated on reddit, there would be a guaranteed entrant into the conversation. Most people don't even circle back to the point of that argument, which is to say that women have no right to walk alone and men are instinctual animals without self control, because they've derailed enough that they can make out like they win with their analogy. If you want to keep someone on topic, you have to fisk them a certain amount to get them to stick to the subject. You have to bypass all the other crap they want to say and the analogies they want to use to fail to prove anything, and thus you have to quote the relevant bits, rather than take general aim and ending up agreeing that men are just like lions.\n\nI would propose not that fisking is a problem, but that [gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop) is actually the bigger problem. People don't bother to research or inform themselves. They don't click on links, they don't reseach, they don't read. They're ready to fire off a reply at the drop of a hat.\n\nIn addition, it can be helpful to quote the bits you are speaking to. For example, I don't disagree with this bit:\n\n&gt;For those who do not recognize the word, fisk is British slang that means \"to refute or criticize (a journalistic article or blog) point by point. \n\nI show my acceptance of this bit by only quoting the points I disagree with. Quoting this is merely clutter, and only problematic fiskers actually tend to do that and reply to each point, like \"Agreed\". You already know that's a wall of text to scroll past. ",

I think there is an area between restructuring the argument and &amp;quot;fisking&amp;quot; that would be really effective; basically fisk the heaviest theme with a counterargument instead of a factual refutation because debate thrives on arguments more than it does on refutations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, fisking - if done too finely - can definitely come across as hostile and/or pedantic. The purpose of effective debate is always to arrive at a peaceful conclusion because animus closes the debate, and the belittlement of a debate opponent will create animus.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

For what should turn out to be a classical example of problems with this approach (or maybe, the abuse of it) go watch the UK Ch. 4 interview between Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman.\n\n\"So, what you're saying is...\"\n\n\"No, that is not what I'm saying....I didn't say anything like that.\"\n\nI'd have to look more closely at that study, but I suspect that it's deeply flawed. If it doesn't account for the fact that a large portion of people who come here and post CMVs aren't actually posting in good faith, then it cannot represent very well what does and doesn't work. They probably only looked at the texts of awarded deltas without seeing how often these approaches do not work by studying all the arguments that do not receive deltas. I emphatically concede that I could be wrong on my thoughts on the study; I haven't read it. All I'm saying is that in my experience here, the greatest variable on whether a delta is awarded is the good faith or open mindedness of the OP. ",

For what should turn out to be a classical example of problems with this approach (or maybe, the abuse of it) go watch the UK Ch. 4 interview between Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, what you&amp;#39;re saying is...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, that is not what I&amp;#39;m saying....I didn&amp;#39;t say anything like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d have to look more closely at that study, but I suspect that it&amp;#39;s deeply flawed. If it doesn&amp;#39;t account for the fact that a large portion of people who come here and post CMVs aren&amp;#39;t actually posting in good faith, then it cannot represent very well what does and doesn&amp;#39;t work. They probably only looked at the texts of awarded deltas without seeing how often these approaches do not work by studying all the arguments that do not receive deltas. I emphatically concede that I could be wrong on my thoughts on the study; I haven&amp;#39;t read it. All I&amp;#39;m saying is that in my experience here, the greatest variable on whether a delta is awarded is the good faith or open mindedness of the OP. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
