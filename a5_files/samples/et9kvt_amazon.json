You want to have foreign military come on over and protect Amazonian cultural heritage? That sounds like a good idea to you? When in our history has a foreign army invaded somewhere and preserved the heritage of the place they invaded? &amp;quot;Hey you&amp;#39;re not preserving your own culture, so it&amp;#39;s ours now.&amp;quot; That is paradoxical! Oxymoronic! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, there&amp;#39;s an important natural resource in a foreign land that could be exploited and destroyed for profit. What historical precedent makes you think the &lt;em&gt;US Miliatary&lt;/em&gt; is trustworthy to protect it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There also isn't any \"law\" governing national sovereignty: it's  almost absolute. There are no \"clauses\" or laws that regulate it. Countries determine what happens in their borders and  agree to  restrictions  via treaty, not being invaded by armed force.\n\n&gt;Why would they have to revert to coal? Could go clean.\n\nBecause they are a big country which needs lots of power, and coal is cheap and easy to setup. My point is that *they already use clean energy much more then other countries of comparable population size.* Why would you possibly want to *not* have them continue to do this?\n\n&gt;Indigenous people shouldn't be forced out, they've lived there without destroying too much of it so there's no need to force them to do anything different we can let them be, right? \n\nIndigenous people also make agreements  so they can profit from their land. 250 agreements in Canada for example exist between indigenous groups and mining companies so that the indigenous people not only have good paying jobs guaranteed at the mine,, but can profit via royalties from their own resources.  Companies obviously get access to the resources in exchange. I'm sure similar agreements exist somewhere in the countries in South America who would be affected by this. More importantly, who are we to take away indigenous tribes right to *choose to make an agreement if they want.*\n\n\n&gt;5. I really don't see the nation of Brazil deciding to fight the entire united nation forces, they'd obviously lose and I don't think they'd go into that fight, no way. If they do, fuck it at some point as a planet we have to say enough is enough. I think the damage of a war against Brazil is less than the damage Brazil is doing to the planet and future generations and even our own generation.\n\nThey have 84 million men of military age, and 3 million come to military age every year (obviously not the entire population would be conscriptex, but even a portion of this being drafted would dwarf total US military manpower). That is a ***huge*** population. Generally, when invaded, countries fight against the invaders, even if they have no hope of winning. Saddam Hussein fought against America and the coalition forces when they invaded even though there was no hope. \n\nBrazil has ***alot*** more people and a bigger military then Iraq and a massive logistics advantage. Not to mention the other 9 or so countries effected. \n\n&gt;6. I'm not sure how you'd occupy it but I'm not sure you need to. Just use satellite data to see what's happening and then send out special forces to stop it.\n\nSo use spec ops to kill some farmers who decide to chop down a tree for firewood?\n\n&gt;3. Yes it would hurt the economy, but what's worse, losing the Amazon or forcing Brazil to adapt and stop being the villain of the earth.\n\nWhen the country collapses I'm sure all the people, out of a job, will be happy to not begin chopping down trees for the fuel they need  to keep themselves warm, after becoming homeless.",

He downplayed the problem a lot, and he has a lot questionable (and one might say downright dumb) policies, specially regarding international help, but I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve seem he disobey any judicial decisions on the matter, and he did take measures and sent the army to the region, which did help, but it just isn&amp;#39;t a simple problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

"body": "So this has alot of problems.\n\n1. This would violate the national sovereignty of several nations, especially Brazil.\n\n2. It would also cause other problems which could make things like climate change worse. For example, Brazil draws the large majority of  its electricity from hydroelectic  dams. Building them requires flooding some parts of the rain forest, but allows a nation of approximately 200 million people to have a source of clean energy. If Brazil isn't allowed to build those dams and destroy a small part of the forest in exchange for power, then they would have to revert to some power source like coal.\n\n\n\n3. It would destroy the economy in Brazil and other countries. There are some things like mining that require the clearing of segments of rain forest to build their mine and infastructure for supporting it, such as roads to cities, etc. If the countries in the area don't have any ability to manage resource extraction because of some international military coalition, a ton of people would lose their job and they would be in economic and political turmoil.\n\n4. It would be interfering with the rights of indigenous people who have claims to the land and agreements with the governments in the area.\n\n5. It would result In a bloody war, or possibly several. It  would have a  destabilizing effect which would result in  one of two things: cause a massive amount of wars in the region as the nations in South America fought over the remaining resources, or more likely, banded together to resist the invaders. The countries there, especially Brazil, with a population over  200 million people, are well armed with modern militaries. Most importantly, they would have a massive logistics advantage and likely the nations would unite and form a military alliance, and have a united front against this invading international coalition. No nation could sit by and allow a violation of their sovereignty like this without responding with force. The logistical advantage they would have would be enormous, and potentially mean they could fight the war to a bloody stalemate.\n\n6.

First of all, our last real war (1932) was against Peru because we precisely wanted a piece of the Amazon, so it's an integral part of our national identity, of our binationalism. Plus you have to know very well what is the Amazon (would the cities inside the Amazon, like Iquitos, Leticia or Manaus) be part of this international organization, and what nationality would these persons have then?\n\nAnd it's hypocrite as hell. The years when most of the Amazon was damaged (including the genocide of many communities there) was during the rubber fever which was managed by American and British neoimperialists, nowadays the environmental damage is not anything close to what those criminals did. It's also hypocrite because most developed countries have deforested much bigger territories than the Amazon, so why can't we manage our own resources? Our governments are doing plenty so don't worry and even if we wanted to chop down the jungle, who the hell are the UN or any power to tell us that we can't do that?\n\nDo you even know how big the Amazon is? You would have to cut Brazil in half, Colombia in half, Peru in half, parts of Bolivia and since the Amazon intersects with the Chaco Boreal (northern Paraguay) how would you determine those limits?\n\nMy plans for the jungle would be to revitalize the navigation of the rivers and create a very big trade in my hypothetical South American union where we would be owners of our resources and free to do whatever we want with them. The last thing I would do is give it to a biased international organization managed by world powers.\n\nNeedless to say, I would be ready to go down to the Amazon and fight for our part of the Amazon against foreigners, just as we did in 1932.",

Every once in a while we might go to a doctor and check but if the doctor makes money by selling lungs, no matter what quality, he will be perfectly fine having you die for profit. \nHowever in brazil they have chronic chest pain, they know they have a lung problem and to ensure their survival, they will do whatever they can to make sure their lungs are ok. \n\nThe connection brazil has to the amazon is too valuable to have it entrusted with anyone else, Brazil has grown weary, throughout the last couple of decades their politicians betrayed them, their companies have left them and corrupt practices have grown with power. \n\nIf there is a god in this world, he left brazil with nothing less nor anything more then the amazon and no one is taking that away from them.",

Every once in a while we might go to a doctor and check but if the doctor makes money by selling lungs, no matter what quality, he will be perfectly fine having you die for profit. \nHowever in brazil they have chronic chest pain, they know they have a lung problem and to ensure their survival, they will do whatever they can to make sure their lungs are ok. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The connection brazil has to the amazon is too valuable to have it entrusted with anyone else, Brazil has grown weary, throughout the last couple of decades their politicians betrayed them, their companies have left them and corrupt practices have grown with power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there is a god in this world, he left brazil with nothing less nor anything more then the amazon and no one is taking that away from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The Amazon would kill more people then enemy combatants would in an occupation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I understand that it’s our planet and it effects us all. But why stop there? The arctic circle needs protection, sarengeti, the Nile, and other waterways.  The fucking oceans. You are basically looking for the multinational coalition to conquer the world by force in the name of emvironmentalism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The easier solution would be to make the rainforest obsolete.  Make giant keep forests, plant trees.  Get your multinational coalition to practice what they preach, and turn vast territories into otherwise unusable jungles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
