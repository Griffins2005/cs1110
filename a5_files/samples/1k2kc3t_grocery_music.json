There was a grocery store somewhere I used to live where they&amp;#39;d play &lt;em&gt;Love Yourself&lt;/em&gt; by Justin Bieber, and the vocals of that song are literally him whimpering at you. It really seemed like an uncalled-for violation of my emotional state to have that worming into my ears while I was picking up spring mix or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

"body": "Totally fair, and honestly, white noise or ambient nature sounds could be a pretty solid middle ground. It wouldn’t hijack anyone’s emotions, it wouldn’t be polarizing in taste, and it *would* still serve the function of masking harsh or jarring noises. Rainforest sounds, soft wind, maybe even low café hums, all of those feel a lot more peaceful than some Top 40 heartbreak anthem blaring from the ceiling speakers.\n\nBut here’s something I’ve been wondering: do we *really* experience white noise or ambient sounds as “neutral”? Like, for people with sensory sensitivities, I could see that being a godsend, but I also wonder if for others, it might just feel… Eerie? Artificial? Even subtly agitating over time? I’ve been in cafés or stores that use ambient tracks, and sometimes it starts to feel like I’m in a dystopian simulation, especially if the environment is otherwise sterile or empty.\n\nI guess I’m asking: would you want *every* store to switch to that? Or are you more in favor of giving customers the ability to choose, like a rotating quiet hour policy, or maybe even signage that tells you what kind of atmosphere to expect inside (kind of like how some restaurants signal whether they’re quiet or lively)?\n\nBecause I agree that current practice doesn’t really serve everyone, especially not people who *don’t* want unsolicited nostalgia bombs while they’re just trying to get milk. But I also think there’s probably a chunk of shoppers who actually *do* get comfort or focus from music in a way that ambient noise doesn’t quite replicate.\n\nCurious where you’d draw that line, like, if music is inherently exclusionary, is ambient sound really more democratic? Or does that just shift who feels left out?",

"body": "Totally hear where you’re coming from, I’ve definitely had moments where a song hit me out of nowhere and just *ruined* the vibe while I was trying to focus on something basic like buying eggs. That sense of being emotionally hijacked by a sad ballad or an overplayed pop song in aisle 6? It’s real.\n\nAnd the accessibility angle you mentioned is important. For people with sensory sensitivities, autistic folks, people with anxiety, even just people who are overwhelmed by busy environments, the added layer of music *can* feel like an unnecessary assault. So I don’t think your view is unreasonable at all.\n\nThat said, I wonder if the issue isn’t music in grocery stores, but *what kind* of music, and maybe even *how* it’s played.\n\nLike, grocery stores don’t just throw on the radio randomly. Most of them use curated “muzak”-style services that are chosen *specifically* to nudge shopping behavior, slower tempo songs to keep you lingering longer, major keys to encourage positive feelings about products, etc. And it seems like stores *do* benefit from this, at least in terms of sales data. That doesn’t automatically justify it, but it shows there’s a strategic intent behind it beyond just “entertainment.”\n\nBut here’s what gets me thinking in a different direction: even though music is polarizing, silence isn’t neutral either. For some people, silence in a public place makes them feel self-conscious or awkward. They feel like everyone’s watching them. For others, silence can amplify the annoying sounds of shopping, carts squeaking, kids crying, register beeps. Music can kind of smooth those edges.\n\nSo maybe the goal shouldn’t be *no music* but *opt-out-able* music? Like what if stores had quiet hours, or even better, gave people access to silent or customizable playlists via headphones, like a “silent disco” but for shopping? That way, those who want peace and quiet can have it, and those who actually enjoy the background music don’t feel like it’s been taken from them.\n\nI’m curious: would something like quiet hours or ambient-only tracks (no vocals, no lyrics) feel like a decent compromise to you? Or do you think the whole music-in-commerce thing is just fundamentally flawed?",

"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Totally hear where you’re coming from, I’ve definitely had moments where a song hit me out of nowhere and just &lt;em&gt;ruined&lt;/em&gt; the vibe while I was trying to focus on something basic like buying eggs. That sense of being emotionally hijacked by a sad ballad or an overplayed pop song in aisle 6? It’s real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the accessibility angle you mentioned is important. For people with sensory sensitivities, autistic folks, people with anxiety, even just people who are overwhelmed by busy environments, the added layer of music &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; feel like an unnecessary assault. So I don’t think your view is unreasonable at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I wonder if the issue isn’t music in grocery stores, but &lt;em&gt;what kind&lt;/em&gt; of music, and maybe even &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it’s played.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, grocery stores don’t just throw on the radio randomly. Most of them use curated “muzak”-style services that are chosen &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; to nudge shopping behavior, slower tempo songs to keep you lingering longer, major keys to encourage positive feelings about products, etc. And it seems like stores &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; benefit from this, at least in terms of sales data. That doesn’t automatically justify it, but it shows there’s a strategic intent behind it beyond just “entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here’s what gets me thinking in a different direction: even though music is polarizing, silence isn’t neutral either. For some people, silence in a public place makes them feel self-conscious or awkward. They feel like everyone’s watching them. For others, silence can amplify the annoying sounds of shopping, carts squeaking, kids crying, register beeps. Music can kind of smooth those edges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe the goal shouldn’t be &lt;em&gt;no music&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;opt-out-able&lt;/em&gt; music? Like what if stores had quiet hours, or even better, gave people access to silent or customizable playlists via headphones, like a “silent disco” but for shopping? That way, those who want peace and quiet can have it, and those who actually enjoy the background music don’t feel like it’s been taken from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m curious: would something like quiet hours or ambient-only tracks (no vocals, no lyrics) feel like a decent compromise to you? Or do you think the whole music-in-commerce thing is just fundamentally flawed?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

As far as whether or not it is unfair for a grocery store to play whatever music they are playing; customers are not required to go into a specific grocery store. It is the store owner's private property, so what is fair is that they can play the music they want to play (and have rights to play). What's not fair is to expect them to cater their music selection to you.\n\n*\"Evidence suggests that unwelcome music can cause* [*real harm*](https://neurosciencenews.com/music-productivity-psychology-28562/) *to people’s productivity\"*\n\nThis study is about the wrong kind of music (\"misfit music\") being played in the workplace having a negative impact - not music being played at all.  If playing music benefits the store's bottom line, then that is an indication that they should play it - because the point of a business is to generate profit. There have been studies showing that music being played in stores indeed does help sales - the article you link to even acknowledges that music can be beneficial to employees in terms of productivity, engagement, and well-being.\n\n*\"there are almost certainly people with sensory issues for whom the practice of playing popular music in grocery stores makes them less accessible.\"*\n\nIf catering to those for whom the music makes the store less \"accessible\" is beneficial overall to the business, then sure - but if it is detrimental overall to the business, then I don't see why they should do it or be expected to do it.\n\n*\"If something does need to be played, they could play a nice white noise track of rainforest sounds or something. Not only would this be more agreeable to most customers, it would almost certainly be cheaper for the grocery stores.\"*\n\nDo you have numbers for this? Because if they are not making their own recordings to play, they have to license whatever it is they're playing either way.\n\nThe bottom line is that businesses should do what benefits their business - so if the store owner finds or believes it benefits their business to play whatever music, then that is what they should do. If you don;t want to hear the music in the grocery store, put in earphones and listen to what you want to listen to or put in earplugs.",

"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Optimistically, maybe 1/37 shoppers will enjoy listening to Fireflies by Owl City while picking up items, but that’s just not fair to the vast majority of shoppers who will find it annoying at best.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This percentage / &amp;quot;vast majority&amp;quot; is simply an assumption on your part, so is essentially meaningless.  As far as whether or not it is unfair for a grocery store to play whatever music they are playing; customers are not required to go into a specific grocery store. It is the store owner&amp;#39;s private property, so what is fair is that they can play the music they want to play (and have rights to play). What&amp;#39;s not fair is to expect them to cater their music selection to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Evidence suggests that unwelcome music can cause&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://neurosciencenews.com/music-productivity-psychology-28562/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;real harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;to people’s productivity&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This study is about the wrong kind of music (&amp;quot;misfit music&amp;quot;) being played in the workplace having a negative impact - not music being played at all.  If playing music benefits the store&amp;#39;s bottom line, then that is an indication that they should play it - because the point of a business is to generate profit. There have been studies showing that music being played in stores indeed does help sales - the article you link to even acknowledges that music can be beneficial to employees in terms of productivity, engagement, and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;there are almost certainly people with sensory issues for whom the practice of playing popular music in grocery stores makes them less accessible.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If catering to those for whom the music makes the store less &amp;quot;accessible&amp;quot; is beneficial overall to the business, then sure - but if it is detrimental overall to the business, then I don&amp;#39;t see why they should do it or be expected to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If something does need to be played, they could play a nice white noise track of rainforest sounds or something. Not only would this be more agreeable to most customers, it would almost certainly be cheaper for the grocery stores.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have numbers for this? Because if they are not making their own recordings to play, they have to license whatever it is they&amp;#39;re playing either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that businesses should do what benefits their business - so if the store owner finds or believes it benefits their business to play whatever music, then that is what they should do. If you don;t want to hear the music in the grocery store, put in earphones and listen to what you want to listen to or put in earplugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
