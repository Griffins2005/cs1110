Student-invented experiment with Change My View word usage

In this experiment, I wanted to test whether the use of hedging language—
words like "maybe," "perhaps," "possibly," "might," and "could"—correlates
with persuasiveness in CMV threads. My hypothesis is that comments employing
more hedge markers will appear more tentative and therefore be less effective
at persuading, resulting in a lower persuasive‐rate compared to non‐hedged
comments. I use the A5 `report_usage` function to compute and compare the
relative frequencies of these hedge words in the persuasive vs. nonpersuasive
subtrees of each conversation.


# Assignment statement for target_words_lists in report_experiments() goes below

target_words_lists = [
    ['maybe', 'perhaps', 'possibly', 'might', 'could']
]
